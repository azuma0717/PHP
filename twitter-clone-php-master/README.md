twitter-clone-php
=================

A clone of the basic functionality of twitter.com written in PHP.

###Update 8/1/14 (development indefinitely postponed)

This project began as just a basic showcase of my ability to create systems for user creation, login, posting, following, etc. I have not had much time to devote to it lately and will probably not be doing much work on it in the future, as I have moved on to other projects.

If I could go back I would probably rewrite much of the code and use a proper CSS framework like Bootstrap to give it some nicer styling. I would also focus on client-side interactions more instead of having so many actions initiate another page load.
